* Policies for Interference and Affinity-Aware Placement of 


There are a great number of research works focusing on the placement of cloud applications. While some of these works take into consideration performance, most of them are concerned about reducing infrastructure costs. Besides, **none of them** take into consideration the interference and network affinity characteristics. 

Therefore, in this work, it war createed a placement policies that aim to improve the performance of multi-tier applications by analyzing the interference and network affinity characteristics of each tier. These characteristics work as a force pushing tiers closer or farther depending on the interference and affinity levels. 

This work used **INTP** as a tool to measure the interference levels that the application causes on the hardware.

In conclusion, by using these placement policies, it was showed that multi-tier applications can better utilize the infrastructure, using the same infrastructure but with an improved performance.
