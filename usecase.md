title: Using IntP with stress-ng application
permalink: /Experiments/
---

**Stressâˆ’ng** is a tool that loads and causes stress into a computer system or within an application. You can use it by downloading and installing to your system with the follow command:

```shell
apt-get install stress-ng
```
In order to test most of all data outputs given by IntP, the follows command lines were used:

* stress-ng --cpu N
    * start N workers continuously writing, reading and removing temporary files.
* stress-ng --hdd N
    * start N workers continuously writing, reading and removing temporary files. The default mode is to stress test sequential writes and reads. 
* stress-ng --malloc N
    * start N workers continuously calling malloc function.
* stress-ng --cache N
    * start N workers that performs random-wide spread memory read and writes to stress the CPU cache. 

## Tests and Outputs

The tests below were executed in a blade server PowerEdge M630 with 24 cores and 32 GB of memory. To execute all of our tests, we used 3 shell terminals. First with IntP command:

```shell
stap --suppress-handler-errors -g intp.stp stress-ng
```
 
 The second with output command:

```shell
watch -n2 -d cat /proc/systemtap/stap_*/intestbench
```
 
 The last terminal was used to run the application (stress-ng):

```shell
stressâˆ’ng [OPTION [ARG]] ...
```
 
## Results provided by our tool: 

**$ stress-ng --cpu 12**
```shell
netp    nets    blk     mbw     llcmr   llcocc  cpu
0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.83    0.50
```
This means that, when these parameters were captured in given application point, the application was using 50% of all cpu (**cpu**) resources and 83% of last layer cache (**llcocc**) the hardware had. 

**$ stress-ng --hdd 5**

```shell
netp    nets    blk     mbw     llcmr   llcocc  cpu
0.00    0.00    0.31    0.00    0.00    0.56    0.00
```
Here, the application was using 31% of all disk (**blk**) resources and 56% of last layer cache (**llcocc**) the hardware had.

**$ stress-ng --malloc 1**

```shell
netp    nets    blk     mbw     llcmr   llcocc  cpu
0.00    0.00    0.00    0.10    0.08    0.51    0.07
```
The **llcmr** metric shows a ratio of cycles with outstanding LLC misses to all cycles, in this example is 8%. Also we had a percentage of memory bus interference of 10%.

**$ stress-ng --cache 1**

```shell
netp    nets    blk     mbw     llcmr   llcocc  cpu
0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.05    0.89    0.07
```

These metrics represents the interference caused by the monitored application (in this case stress-ng application): 

* netp - percentage of physical network
* nets - percentage of network queue interference.
* blk - percentage of disk interference.
* mbw - percentage of memory bus interference.
* llcmr - percentage of cache miss.
* llocc - percentage of cache interference.
* cpu - percentage of cpu interference.

## Saving the Results

The above results were captured at some point while the application was running. If you are interested in capturing the history of the parameters given by IntP during the life cycle of the application, the following command can be used:

```shell
watch -n1 -d 'tail /proc/systemtap/stap_*/intestbench -n 1 >> output.txt'
```

Where **output.txt** is the file that contains the results generated by intP every second.
