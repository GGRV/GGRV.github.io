IntP measures the amount of noise an application is susceptible and the interference applications causes one another, but also points out which source of noise is more disturbing performance. This instrumentation enables accurate prediction of the performance degradation that results from contention on shared resources. In addition, it provides outputs for better application placement strategies, which makes datacenter resource efficient and more cost effective.
